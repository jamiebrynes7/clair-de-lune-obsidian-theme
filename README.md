Comes with built-in support for:

- [Sliding Panes Plugin](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian)
- [Todoist Plugin](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/todoist-sync-plugin-v1-3-1/5849/1)
- [Calendar Plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin)

## Usage

**Important:** This theme uses the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [JetBrains Mono](https://jetbrains.com/mono) fonts. For the best experience, I recommend installing these fonts onto your local machine.

1. Open Obsidian and go to the 'Appearance' tab. Ensure that the 'Base mode' setting is set to `Dark mode` and that 'Custom CSS' is turned on.
2. Download `obsidian.css`from the [latest release](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/clair-de-lune-obsidian-theme/releases).
3. Place this in the root of your Obsidian notes directory.
4. Enjoy!
